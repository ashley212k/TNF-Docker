#Computational Manipulation of SPD304 Inhibitor and Docking Programs

##This project generates 200 modifications to a chosen ligand SPD304 and batch docks them to a protein TNF-a in Autodock VINA GNINA for a final ranking. 

The codes and command lines written in this project are tailored to modifying SPD304 as it was the targeted inhibitor for Rheumatoid Arthritis treatment. 
However, the ligand and receptor can be changed as needed to fit other projects. 

Use ChimeraX as the initial program and insert the ligand and receptor by opening the downloaded files or opening the PDB ID
  In this project, PDB ID 2AZ5 was used for its known docking site of SPD304 to the protein TNF-a
Select the ligand and delete to isolate the protein and vice versa
Delete extra solvent, SO4, PO4, H2O, and ions while adding Hydrogens
